1. build two nodes from yaml file using command line with specific ip address, called "peer_handler" and "experimenter"
2. before connecting to other nodes the node connect to the "peer_handler" to know its own ip
3. the node wait for peer_handler's peer_list
4. at the same time, the peer_handler collect ip until it gets enough


"""old""":
the code that used for static ip mode

"""new""":
the code that serves for dynamic ip mode

peer_handler:
ip = '192.168.1.1'

experimenter:
ip = '192.168.1.0'

Step1:
test getting own ip and peer_list

Step2:
change the write_main.py write_compose.py data.py
make a overlay network in the yaml file and let the docker swarm join it

Step3:
change the start_experiment.sh

Step4:
upload GitHub, test on the cloud

下一步，创建overlay网络，在overlay网络下建立随机ip节点
下一步，分别把experimenter、peerhandler和其他节点的设定写入两份yaml文件，前一份通过command line启动，再用docker swarm stack
启动后一份，加入前一份搭建的overlay network
